# EasyMicropython
Collection of easy to use micropython libraries for interfacing with hardware and similar usually complex things.

# Consistant usage across all Easy libraries
You only have to learn how to use an easy library once, and then you can apply the same syntax for all libraries. Dont worry, its easy..

1. pick and choose
   - browse through this repo to find one you want to use on your micropython device
2. get it on your device
   - copy all code from the Easy_[the one you chose].py file present, and save it on your device with the same name
3. simply run help() to print all available functions
   -  ```python
      from Easy_ExampleLibrary import *
      help() 
      ```
